Opioid overdose death rate in Queens is anticipated to be less than the increasing trend thanks to a local family who is taking action against this unforgiving war. 
</P>

 <p> An opioid is a form of medication typically prescribed to treat severe pain. The problem, however, lies in its abuse, with almost 30% of patients becoming addicted to the substance and the relief it provides. Like most drugs, opioids can be misused and over thirty thousand overdoses have occurred in 2013 alone. </P>
 	<p>The opioid epidemic has led a brutal war within New York City, specifically in Queens, where families, such as Mr. Torres’, have been victimized by it. Between the years of 2013 and 2015, 482 people have died in Queens alone, with a pattern that is only increasing in trend. </p>

<p>“My addiction began when my mother was prescribed OxyContin after a really bad car accident…I wanted to see what was so great about [it] so I started sneaking pills and that’s when it all began,” Marcos Torres, former drug addict reveals.</P>

<p>According to Abnormal psychology and integrated approach, part of the reason why opioids are so addictive is because opioids release “feel good” neurotransmitters such as serotonin and dopamine. When an individual stops using the drug, it can leave them   feeling psychologically and physically ill. In order to tolerate the pain, people routinely  use opioids to continue the release of the feel good hormones which can lead to addiction and possibly an overdose. </P>

<p>Marcos Torres is now a big advocate against opioid overdoses in Queens. Sitting on the edge of the chair in front of me, Torres was fidgety, and had a somewhat bewildered look, but nonetheless, he spoke eloquently and knowledgeably on the topic at hand.  </P> 

<p>Torres and other families alike are fearful that there is not enough government involvement within Queens to help individuals and families affected by this epidemic. “Family members should be educated about this epidemic because it can cause deaths, pain and heartache.” In New York, Queens ranks third in the most opioid burdened communities behind only the Bronx and Brooklyn, according to the Department of Health. This shows that overall, this issue deserves the attention of government officials, especially with Queens’ 2.3 million population. </p>

	<p> “Some of my family members just look down on me like I’m the black sheep of the family. The fact that I followed in the same shoes that I grew up around makes me the bad guy.” </P>

	<p>This is just one person's story, but it relates to many across the country. A revelatory tale of the nation’s ongoing battle between prescription and synthetic opioids. The nation’s high Opioid death rankings have New York state at the top of the list only second to Ohio. Addiction, for the most part, does not begin out of nowhere. The source of these addictions begin within the household with these prescription and over-the-counter prescription medications.</p>

	<p>“Five subjects reported abusing prescription opioids, most notably OxyContin…They reported tolerance to the drug's effects and physical withdrawal symptoms when deprived of OxyContin. They reported that heroin was more readily available and less expensive than OxyContin and that they would never have tried heroin had they not become addicted to OxyContin,” states the American Academy of Family Physicians.</p>

	<p> Sources reveal that prescription medicines are like double-edged swords. They are good in the sense that they are helping to provide physical and neurological relief for severe injury and chronic pain sufferers, however, patients depend on these pills and continuously rely on them for comfort and relief, leading them to become addicts.</p>
	<p>There are many approaches that the state of New York can consider in addressing the opioid epidemic. A few of these approaches include building more health departments in opioid burdened communities, providing resources to help educate patients of the medicine they’re consuming, and giving the public opioid related data on a nationwide level so that everybody knows exactly what is going on.

		<p>Patient education would aim to “prevent poisonings, overdoses and addictions before they occur – [r]educe opioid use in the general population [and] [e]ngage providers in improving opioid prescribing practices” said Kitty Gelberg, Director, Bureau of Occupational Health & Injury Prevention.</p>


		<p>Educating members of the community on the horrors and dangers of prescription medication would have beneficial impacts in lowering the mass effects of the opioid epidemic. This is an issue that is becoming increasingly worse and the biggest problem is that members of these communities, specifically within Queens, are not informed. Torres mentions that individuals are raised to believe in their doctors, but in reality, one of the biggest culprits and initiators of the opioid epidemic are our doctors.</p>

		<p>Patients no longer should completely rely on health professionals. If they actually had the resources and knowledge to make decisions for themselves based on data behind the drugs and possibility of addictions, then the rates of death due to prescription-based opioid abuse would drop significantly. But even if addiction has already begun, knowledge of what addicts are actually putting into their bodies would greatly aid in rehabiltory efforts.</p>

		<p> In the rehabilitation stages, it is very hard for addicts to overcome their addictions, especially with the implications of withdrawal symptoms and family around who are still partaking in these practices. Like Torres and many other addicts, they all have a personal story, which may help others struggling with the same issues and cope with their own addictions.</p>

		<p>“It’s just time man, time is the only cure. I hope one day everything will be alright… I am doing what I can to earn money and earn my family’s trust, and getting my family off these drugs but nothing happens overnight... Also, I am devoting my time to help people overcome their addiction, and using my experience as a guiding light for them. This is an endless battle that will last forever for [addicts] like me. All we can do is take things one step at a time and try our hardest from going back to the drugie life,” Marcos Torres, former addict.</p>

		<p>Now as he devotes himself to helping drug users, Torres sees a continued double standard for Queens residents who are stripped of the opportunity to learn and get the help they need while in this epidemic.</p>

		<p> “Ultimately, time is the cure for all affected individuals, everybody from addicts to the government. The Opioid overdose issue is a Nationwide epidemic and it is affecting many states,” Opioid Researcher, Queens College, Nick Delarentist . </p>
